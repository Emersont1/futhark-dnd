# Futhark D&D Simulation code 

This code is for my approach to probability theory simulations for simulating a dungeons and dragons game

+ `core.fut` Functions that are vital and ought to be in the prelude
+ `rational.fut` Implementation of rational numbers (uses 64 bit integers)
+ `rollcollection.fut` A collection of types and their respective probability
